Project Proposal
Artificial Life: Embodied Intelligence – University of Waterloo

Name: Amrita Milan Bhogayata
Affiliation: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo
Project title: Behavioral analysis of multi-agent systems of Braitenberg vehicles[1].

1.	Project research question and/or research hypothesis
The motivation behind this project is to carry out an extensive experimental analysis of different systems of Braitenberg vehicles[1] to examine what kind of behavioral traits emergence out of a system of Braitenberg vehicles[1]. What kind of interaction occurs between different types of Braitenberg vehicles[1] when they are put together in presence of multiple stimuli? How Braitenberg Vehicles[1] navigate their path and avoid collisions while doing so? How different permutations of a greater number of sensors and actuator affect the behavior of the Braitenberg vehicle[1]? Also, how these different types of Braitenberg vehicles[1] organization themselves in regards to the group of other kinds of Braitenberg vehicles[1]? Majorly, what kind of navigation pattern collectively emerges out of the group? 

2.	Experiment: Defining scenario and recording behavior
Number of different scenarios will be investigated to understand the behavior of vehicles will be conducted by adjusting the following parameters of the experiment scenario[3]:
a.	Size of arena
b.	Number of vehicles
c.	Connection type between sensors and motor: direct and cross connection
d.	Activation functions: positive, negative, non-linear [7]
e.	Number of sensors embedded in the vehicle
f.	Types of sensors: Light sensor, distance/proximity sensor and collision/touch sensor[2][6]
g.	Number and relative position of Light sources (Also, intensity of light source can be tweaked to examine the effect on the activation of vehicle’s motor)
h.	Additionally, Stationary or moving stimuli (light source)[5]
i.	Number and position of stationary obstacles: Introduction of stationary obstacle in the trajectory course of these Vehicles (not dynamically)

Combination of different kinds of vehicles in different environment can help us understand what kind of a social, intelligent and interactive system arises from a group of different or similar type of Braitenberg Vehicles[1]. Here, collision and trajectory monitoring will help us evaluate the results.   
 
3.	Technology/Algorithm/Software for Implementation 
•	Software for Simulation: Webots
•	Language for Algorithm/Code Implementation: Python
•	Sensor codes: Webots Devices[8]
•	Braitenberg Vehicle proto code: FourWheelRobot.proto[9]
•	Simulations of Braitenberg Vehicles: Using processing.py[5] is the already implemented idea which this project will extend and perform experiments on the resultant system available.

4.	Critical Evaluation and analysis of result
Number of collision and trajectory of each vehicle in the system of Braitenberg vehicles[1] in the various scenarios will be documented. This experiment will lead us to define an abstract anthropomorphic social construct that emerges from these different configuration systems. This will also help us answer the role of embodiment in perceiving the environment when the behavior of vehicles with just light sensor and other vehicles with light, touch and distance sensor will be examined in different scenarios. 
A table as below with be computed to show results numerically:
Variables of scenario	Total number of collisions	Number of Vehicle Collisions	Number of Collisions with arena wall	Number of Collision with stationary objects
				
				
	Rate of collision will be also be computed in each case. Trajectory of each vehicle will be stored and will be analyzed for identifying any specific behavioral traits.
